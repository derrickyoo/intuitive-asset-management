        <div class="well">
          <p>Final Cut Server is the premier digital asset management and workflow automation system designed specifically for the post-production and production environment. While most digital asset management systems are designed primarily to handle finished assets, Final Cut Server is designed to organize and automate all of your assets from their initial ingest, through the entire editorial process, and on through the approval and delivery processes.</p>

          <p>With some of the strongest application integration capabilities of any digital asset management system created, what makes Final Cut Server so powerful is the ability to completely customize its look and function specific to any workflow. Through the use of custom programming and web service integration we have never run into a problem or a workflow that could not be automated and/or fixed with Final Cut Server.</p>

          <p>The Intuitive Asset Management programming team has been working with Final Cut Server since its release. We have designed many scripts and an entire application around the central database. This enables us to deliver custom application functionality within days instead of months.</p>

          <p>Final Cut Server is the premier workflow automation system on the market today. Give us a call or check out some of our videos to find out more.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">XSAN<span class="muted">.</span></h2>
        <div class="well">
          <p>XSAN software is at the heart of many of the systems that we service, maintain, and deploy. The roots of XSAN filesystem come from an older system called CentraVision. This is the same filesystem that is the basis for Stornext as well as Active Storage's ActiveSAN technology (All of which we support and deploy). The benefit of XSAN over its rivals is two-fold.</p>

          <p>1. Cost (XSAN licenses cost almost 1/3 the price of Stornext and can be sold in smaller quantities that ActiveSAN licenses)</p>

          <p>2. Apple Support (When you have a complicated issue with a SAN its helpful to have the OS developers and and SAN support team all under one roof so there is no confusion whose responsibility it is to provide support.)</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">ActiveSAN<span class="muted">.</span></h2>
        <div class="well">
          <p>ActiveSAN from Active Storage represents one of the newest SAN technologies presented that finally takes on the long overdue challenge of simplifying the SAN. Apples XSAN was a start in this direction, but with the discontinued Xserve product many clients have been looking for an alternative and I can say with confidence that I believe that ActiveSAN is the replacement for the Apple Xserve that we have all been waiting for.</p>

          <p>Alex Grossman, ActiveStorage CEO and Founder was once upon a time the person over at Apple who helped make XSAN a reality. Alex has all of the relationships, experience, and knowledge of this industry segment to provide the best and simplest SAN storage system, and I believe that this is exactly what he has done.</p>

          <p>The only downside to ActiveSAN is the cost-factor. While very competitive against Quantum Stornext, when compared agains the Apple XSAN software for smaller deployments (less than 8 systems), the ActiveSAN is a bit expensive for the smaller post-production companies to get involved with. While the investment would be 100% worth the money, the budget simply isnt there in some organizations.</p>
